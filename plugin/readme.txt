This zip file includes MATLAB code to implement the plug in estimator for the block recursive structural model discussed 
in Goncalves, Herrera, Kilian and Pesavento (2021), forthcoming in the Journal of Econometrics. In the bivariate case 
the model reduces to a recursive structural model.

The main file is plugin.m. The file includes instructions on the definition of the various inputs and the output. The 
remaining files are called up when executing plugin.m.
